### Instructions for Running the Model

#### 1. Preprocessing Proteins and Peptides

To preprocess the proteins and peptides in the input sample pairs, generate their respective amino acid vector representations and contact map files. Follow steps below:

##### Generating Amino Acid Vectors

1. Store all the amino acid sequences of proteins and peptides in the sample pair into a FASTA file.
2. Write the path of this FASTA file into the appropriate location in the `data_preprocessing/generate_embeddings.py` script.
3. Run the script with the command `python generate_embeddings.py` to generate an NPZ file that stores the amino acid vectors of all proteins and peptides in the sample pair. Each protein/peptide vector representation is stored in an NPY file and has the shape `L*1024`, where `L` is the sequence length of the protein/peptide.

##### Generating Contact Map Files

1. Obtain the PDB files of the proteins and peptides from AlphaFold.
2. Write these files into the appropriate locations in the `data_preprocessing/generate_contact_map.py` script, along with the corresponding sequence TXT files.
3. Run the script with the command `python generate_contact_map.py` to generate contact map files for the proteins and peptides in NPZ format. The shape of the contact map is `L*L` (where `L` is the sequence length).

#### 2. Model Training and Testing

We have provided model files trained using peptide-protein complexes from the [Propedia database](http://bioinfo.dcc.ufmg.br/propedia2/index.php/download) as positive samples, along with an independent test set. To run model predictions, execute the following command:

```sh
cd test_sample_model
python my_main_test.py
```

##### Input for the Sample Run

The input for this sample run includes the receptor-peptide pairs used for testing, saved in a TSV file (`test_sample_model/data/actions/sample_cmap.actions.tsv`) with the following columns:

- `receptor ID`
- `peptide ID`
- `label`

The preprocessed amino acid vector representations and corresponding contact map files are also required. These are stored as follows:

- Amino acid vector representations in NPZ format: `test_sample_model/data/sample_embeddings.npz`
- Contact map files in NPZ format: `test_sample_model/data/sample_cmap/`

For example, consider the testing sample pair `1a1m_A 1a1m_C 1`:

##### Output of the Test Sample Run

The prediction result of the test sample pair is saved in an XLS file with the following format:

- `index`: Ordinal number representing the sample pair.
- `receptor`: Receptor ID.
- `peptide`: Peptide ID.
- `label`: Classification of sample pairs (1 for interactive, 0 for non-interactive).
- `predict_score`: Probability of interaction between sample pairs. A threshold of 0.5 is used; scores >= 0.5 indicate interaction.
- `predict_label`: Predicted interaction (1 for interaction, 0 for no interaction).

Example:

| index | receptor | peptide | label | predict_score | predict_label |
|----|-----------|---------|------|---------------|---------------|
| 0  | 1a1m_A    | 1a1m_C  | 1    | 0.85          | 1             |
